<p> Gloria_Yi: that day i watched the late night turn to morning outside my window: the sky turned to deep dark red; the same way the sea's waves drew back in low tide, turned black.... and what i once thought was home.… became a complete and utter landscape of desperation</p>
<p> part 12 of Sophiex’s series: It’s there on the windowsill when I get back. A comically huge wine glass, perched on the windowsill, filled with water - and flowers? Fresh flowers from our garden - no, not ours, and not mine. I never did anything there. I watch her stand by the sink, arms folded tightly, and then look at the flowers. Violets, rosebuds, crocus, and dill. Oh, does this girl know what I missed. “I’m sorry,” I say. “Forget about it, Phillips,” she tells me. Then she sweeps out of the room, and that’s the last I hear out of her. </p>
<p> LEO.: I’m not good at believing or listening, or anything, really, but one day he throws open the balcony door and makes me sit there. I don’t understand why; it’s pouring like mad outside, but something compels me to stay. Wrapped in his arms the way I shouldn’t be. Something about negative ions in rain causing biochemical reactions reducing stress? Constantly being surrounded by positive ions? I don’t get it. All I know is that this is home. And then I wake up alone, drenched in my tears. </p>
<p> AndrzejL: I stare down at my phone and then glance up guilty at the other passengers. They’re not watching. The contact page is labeled DO NOT CONTACT. Clicking unblock, I type in, “heyyyy” - four ‘y’s, enough to get my point across but not enough to make him think I’m drunk or something. Three small dots begin blinking back at me from the otherside of the screen. </p>
<p> LyraCEM: The blood is everywhere, dripping down my neck. With a gasp, I sink down below the bathwater. It doesn’t turn pink. Cautiously, I run my fingers over my neck. New skin healing over a wound. I am fine. I reach out to grip the sides of the tub, only belatedly remembering this is not my skinny tub in a shoebox studio apartment but the huge, pool-like tub of wherever he’s brought me. He knocks on the door. “Darling?” I am not his darling. I do not want to be his darling. “It’s time.” I wish I was dead already.</p>
